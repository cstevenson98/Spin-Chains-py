# # FUNCTION: corrections

# DESCRIPTION: Given a set of pertubative operators and the
#              eigenspectrum (both eigenenergies and eigenstates),
#              calculate the set of perturbative corrections which go
#              into the wavefunction.

def corrections(Vset, e_en, e_vec):

    return correct_set
