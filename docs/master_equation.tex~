\section{Master equation for a dissipative spin-chain}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{marcoscav}
  \caption{An array of coupled optical cavities, with losses from
    each site. The cavities are assumed to be highly non-linear, which means
    the effective occupation of photons at each site is limited to the
    $n=0,1$ subspace. The cavities are be driven to keep the photon number
    non-zero. Losses are characterised by the rate $\Gamma$.
    The effective Hamiltonian is that of
    a nearest-neighbour coupled spin-chain. (Figure taken from \cite{Marcos2012}: D. Marcos, A. Tomadin, S. Diehl, and P. Rabl. Photon condensation in circuit quantum electrodynamics by engineered dissipation. \textit{New J. Phys.}, \textbf{14}, 2012.)}
    \label{fig:coupledcavities}
\end{figure}
The project will mainly focus on a particular many-body quantum system,  that of an array of optical cavities, with nearest-neighbour coupling. Additionally, these cavities will have strong non-linearities, restricting the local basis to a two-level approximation (see Figure \ref{fig:coupledcavities}). Great interest lies in the non-equilibrium dynamics of driven-dissipative optical cavities. The reason for this is the rich non-equilibrium phase diagrams, with novel non-equilibrium phase transitions \cite{Diehl2008,Diehl2010,Marcos2012}.
\par It can be shown (see [...]) that coupled non-linear optical cavities can replicate spin-chain physics. This comes about when the cavities have stong Kerr nonlinearities. Consider an array of $N$ coupled non-linear optical cavities, decribed by the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  H_{cc}=\sum_i \omega_0 a^\dagger_ia_i - J \sum_i(a^\dagger_ia_{i+1}+a_ia^\dagger_{i+1})
  + \frac{U}{2}\sum_{i}a^\dagger_ia^\dagger_ia_ia_i.
\end{equation}
Here, $a^\dagger_i$ and $a_i$ create or destroy a photon in the $i^\text{th}$ cavity. The sum runs over all $N$ cavity labels, $i$. The bare cavity frequency is $\omega_c$ and the non-linearity is decribed by an interaction strength $U$. Finally, neighbouring cavities may interact with one another, with a hopping strength $J$. The spin physics is emulated in the regime where the energy associated with the non-linearity is far above all other energy scales, namely $\omega_c,t\ll U$. This restricts the population of photons on each site to either $1$ or $0$.  Correspondingly, the physics is effectively decribed by a chain of spins, with an effective Hamiltonian of the form
\begin{equation}
  H_{eff}=\sum_i\omega_0 \sigma^z_i -J \sum_i (\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}+\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}).
\end{equation}
In this Hamiltonian, we are now describing the occupation of a site in a spin language, with an up-spin corresponding to the presence of a photonic excitation and a down-spin corresponding to no excitation. $\sigma^z_i$ is the Pauli operator acting in the $z$ quadrature, and $\sigma^\pm_i$ is a spin raising(lowering) operator, written in terms of the $x$- and $y$-spin Pauli operators as $\sigma^\pm_i=\sigma^x_i\pm i\sigma^y_i$. Because this system has site-to-site coupling, the resulting eigenstates are inherently non-local. 
\par The cavities also dissipate into their environment, and are driven such that the photon population is above zero. The exact nature of this dissipation depends on the physical processes, and there are many frameworks to treat dissipation. This report focuses on the application of a quantum master equation to describe the dissipation. A master equation is the governing equation of motion for the coupled-cavity quantum system, in the presence of environmental dissipation and driving. Typically, a phenominologically motivated master equation is written down, without considering a detailed model for the system-bath interaction. For example, it may be the case that each of the optical cavities is imperfect, and that they each leak light into their environment. A rate of loss, $\Gamma$ can be introduced, which characterises the dissipation from each site, independently of one another. This is justified in certain optical regimes \cite{hartmann}, and has been shown to display photon crystallisation even in the presence of the losses and a coherent drive.
\par The non-equilibrium physics that emerges maintains long-range order in its steady states, despite the incoherent loss from each cavity. The question then is: \textit{what results by considering all normal-modes in the dissipation, not simply site-independent dissipation?} This project investigates the result of correctly treating dissipation by expanding in a basis of the spins Hamiltonian, in the regime of a zero-temperature environment. We consider a special case of a system-environment coupling, in a rotating wave approximation, which preserves total excitation number in the composite system-environment quantum system.
\par 
\par In this section, we introduce a general model for a chain of spins, each coupled to their own environment. By considering a special form of the system-environment interaction, we derive a master equation which takes account of the full dissipative dynamics. This is acheived by not simply introducing independent decay terms, but by starting with a composite system-environment quantum system and calculating the master equation for the reduced system density matrix. 
%
\subsection{Model}
The most general class of
models one may write down to describe a chain of interacting spins is
the fully anisotropic Heisenberg (or XYZ-) model. This is represented
by the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
  H_S = -J\sum_{i=1}^N
  \left(\Delta_x\sigma^x_i\sigma^x_{i+1}+\Delta_y\sigma^y_i\sigma^y_{i+1}+
  \Delta_z\sigma^z_i\sigma^z_{i+1}+\frac{g}{J}\sigma^z_i\right),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^x_i$, $\sigma^y_i$ and $\sigma^z_i$ are Pauli operators
describing the spin degree of freedom at site $i$. The dimensionless
parameters $\Delta_x$, $\Delta_y$ and $\Delta_z$ describe the
anisotropic, nearest-neighbour spin-spin interaction strength.
Finally, an external field which tends to align the spins in the
$z$-spin direction has be added with an associated energy scale of
$g$. Finally, $t$ is the hopping parameter, describing the strength of
the internal system interactions. 
\par Periodic boundary
conditions (where we set $\sigma^\gamma_1=\sigma^\gamma_{N+1}$, for all
$\gamma=x,y,z$) may or may not be adopted. In this report the choice
will be stated before any relevant calculation.
\par The
\textit{closed} system dynamics of the system $S$ are captured by the
unitary evolution generated by the Hamiltonian. As such, states of
system $S$, $\ket{\psi}_S$ obey the Schr\"odinger equation
$i\partial_t\ket{\psi}_S=H_S\ket{\psi}_S$ (where $\hbar=1$). However,
this form of the dynamics is not the main concern of this report. The
further influence on the system due to an array of environments, $E$
is considered. Suppose that each lattice site in the chain of spins is
coupled to a local thermal reservoir, denoted $B_i$ (see figure
\ref{fig:dissspinchain}). Each reservoir is modelled as an harmonic
oscillator, so that the free evolution of the environmental degrees of
freedom is captured by the Hamiltonian (the terms bath, reservoir and
environment are used interchangeably):
\begin{equation}
  H_B = \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_k\omega_kb^\dagger_{i,k}b_{i,k}.

      oscillators.}

\end{figure}The $b_{i,k}$ are the bosonic annihilation operators for the
$i^\text{th}$ site, $k^\text{th}$ mode and $\omega_k$ is the energy of
a particle in the $k^\text{th}$ mode. The baths are assumed to be
identical (in that they each have the same $\omega_{k}$) but
are otherwise isolated from one another. This means that the canonical
commutation relations for the bath operators are
$[b_{i,k},b_{j,q}]=[b^\dagger_{i,k},b^\dagger_{j,q}]=0$ and
$[b_{i,k},b^\dagger_{j,q}]=\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}$. Within this
framework, with a system of interest coupled to a large environment,
the system of spins becomes an \textit{open quantum system} (see Figure \ref{fig:open}). In the
theory of open quantum systems \cite{Breuer2002} one wants to
determine the laws of motion for the reduced system dynamics. This
involves tracing over the environments to determine $\dot{\rho}_S(t)$,
the rate of change of the partially traced density matrix
$\rho_S=\Tr_B\{\rho_S\}$.  
\subsection{System-bath interaction}
We are now in position to put the all the elements of a dissipative array of optical cavities. All that is left is to describe the specific interaction between the system and environment. When the array dissipates into an environment, there needs to be a drive to keep the population non-zero. We follow \cite{Biella2015, Genway2014, Joshi2013} and consider a coherent drive, which creates pairs of photons in neighbouring cavities. The driven Hamiltonian has a time dependence, and in the spin language is given by
\begin{align}
  H&=\sum_i\omega_0 \sigma^z_i -J \sum_i (\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}+\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}) \notag\\
  &-\Omega\sum_i\left(\sigma^+_i\sigma^+_{i+1}e^{-2i\omega_Pt}+\sigma^-_i\sigma^-_{i+1}e^{2i\omega_Pt}\right).
\end{align}
The additional non-number-conserving terms $\sigma^+_i\sigma^+_{i+1}e^{-2i\omega_Pt}$ and $\sigma^-_i\sigma^-_{i+1}e^{2i\omega_Pt}$ represent the external coherent drive, which has strength $\Omega$. Finally, we model dissipation by introducing an interaction with a set of environments. This interaction is assumed to be of the form
\begin{equation}
  H_I=\sum_i \sum_k \xi_k \sigma^x_i \otimes (b_{i,k}+b^\dagger_{i,k}).
\end{equation}
\par It is convenient to move into a rotating frame with repect to the driving frequency. When we do this the system operator in the coupling, $\sigma^x_i$ gains a time-dependence and the interaction can we written
\begin{equation}
  H_I=\sum_i \sum_k \xi_k\left(\sigma^+_ib_{i,k}+\sigma^-_ib^\dagger_{i,k}+\sigma^+_ib^\dagger_{i,k}e^{-2i\omega_Pt}+\sigma^-_ib_{i,k}e^{2i\omega_Pt}\right).
\end{equation}
The common assumption, and the assumption we make in this work is that the pump frequency is well above the bare cavity frequency $\omega_0$, and the hopping strength $J$. This means that the fast oscillating terms $\sigma^+_ib^\dagger_{i,k}e^{-2i\omega_Pt}$ and $\sigma^-_ib_{i,k}e^{2i\omega_Pt}$ can be neglected due to averaging. The final interaction in the rotating frame has the simple form
\begin{equation}
  H_I = \sum_i \sum_k \xi_k (\sigma+_ib_{i,k}+\sigma^-_ib^\dagger_{i,k}).
\end{equation}
It is straight-forward to demonstrate that in the rotating frame the Hamiltonian above becomes
\begin{align}
  H&=\sum_i(\omega_0-\omega_P) \sigma^z_i -J \sum_i (\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}+\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}),
\end{align}
with the environments' Hamitlonian being similarly transformed:
\begin{equation}
  H_B = \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_k(\omega_k-\omega_P)b^\dagger_{i,k}b_{i,k}.
\end{equation}
The total system-environment Hamiltonian takes the final form
\begin{align}
  H &= H_S + H_B + H_I \notag \\ &= \sum_i(\omega_0-\omega_P) \sigma^z_i-J\sum_{i=1}^N
  \left(\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}+\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1}\right) \notag
  \\ &\Gap+\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_k(\omega_k-\omega_P)b^\dagger_{i,k}b_{i,k} + \sum_i
  \sum_k \xi_k (\sigma+_ib_{i,k}+\sigma-_ib^\dagger_{i,k}).
\end{align}
This model now contains all the elements to develop an open quantum theory. All that remains is that we calculate the dynamical equation of motion for the system of cavities.

  \label{fig:open}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Equation of motion for $S$}
\par In the Schr\"odinger picture, the
equation of motion for the density matrix of the compsite system $S+E$
is given by the equation:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}=-i[H,\rho].
\end{equation}
In an open quantum system, one traces over the environment, and is
left with an equation of motion for the reduced system density matrix
$\rho_S$ of the form
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}_S=-i[H_S,\rho_S]+\mathcal{D}\rho_S.
\end{equation}
The term $\mathcal{D}\rho_S$ is known as a dissipator of the dynamics
and decribes a generalised relaxation process. We are intersted in
deriving a form for $\mathcal{D}\rho_S$ from \textit{first
  principles}. Often, what is done to arrive at an equation like the
one above is that a form for the dissipator is chosen based of
phenomenological reasoning. In particular, often a dissipator in
Lindblad form
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}[a]\rho_S=a\rho_Sa^\dagger-\frac{1}{2}\{a^\dagger a,
  \rho_S\}
\end{equation}
is chosen. The operator $a$ is a system operator, and is refered to as
a \textit{jump} operator. A dissipator in Lindblad form generates a
form of dynamics which is trace preserving, and crucially, completely
positive. 
\par To
derive the form of $\mathcal{D}$ from scratch we take the standard
approach of deriving a Born-Markov master equation in a weak
system-environment coupling regime. Let us first move into an
interaction picture, so that kets have a time dependence generated by
the `free' Hamiltonian $H_S+H_E$, with operator's time dependence
being generated by the interaction Hamiltonian $H_I(t)$ (see
\cite{Breuer2002} for a complete description of the interaction
picture). In the interaction picture, the equation of motion for the
density matrix of $S+E$ is the von Neumann equation:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}(t)=-i[H_I(t),\rho(t)].
  \label{eqn:vonNeumann}
\end{equation}
The trace over the environment then may be taken, to obtain an
equation of motion for just the system of interest, $S$:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}_S(t)=-i\Tr_B[H_I(t),\rho(t)].
  \label{eqn:vonNeumann2}
\end{equation}
It is in general exceedingly difficult to work with the von Neumann
equation directly, as the step of tracing the environment has a
dependence on the full composite system density matrix, $\rho(t)$. It
is thus necessary to look for approximations to the RHS of Equation
(\ref{eqn:vonNeumann2}).
\par One common set of approximations is the
combination of the Born approximation and the Markov approximation
which, when combined, convert the RHS of Equation
(\ref{eqn:vonNeumann2}) into a Born-Markov master equation. Firstly,
we formally integrate Equation (\ref{eqn:vonNeumann}). This then gives
us a closed form for the density matrix
$\rho(t)=-i\int^tds[H_I(s),\rho(s)]$, which then may be substitured
back into the von Neumann equation, resulting in
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}(t)=-\int^tds[H_I(t),[H_I(s),\rho(s)]].
  \label{eqn:master1}
\end{equation}
This process can of course be repeated \textit{ad infinitum}, by
formally integrating and substituting, resulting in higher and higher
orders of perturbation theory. As was mentioned above, we are going to
work in the weak coupling regime, and so stop this process after one
formal integration and subtitution.
\par The Born approximation says
that the system and environment are sufficiently weakly coupled such
that the total density matrix may be written as a product
$\rho(t)=\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B$. The environment is assumed
to be sufficiently large such that the weak interaction with system
does not perturb its state. We denote the time-constant environmental
density matrix $\tilde{\rho}_B$. This can take many forms, for example
a thermal state
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\rho}_B=\prod_{i,k}\frac{e^{-\beta\omega_{k}
      b^\dagger_{i,k}b_{i,k}}}{\mathcal{Z}},
      \label{eqn:thermal}
\end{equation}
where $\beta=1/k_BT$ is the inverse temperature and
$\mathcal{Z}=\sum_{i,k}e^{-\beta\omega_k}$ is the partition function. Under asssumption the master equation (\ref{eqn:master1}) takes the form,
after tracing over the baths
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}_S(t)=-\int^tds\Tr_B[H_I(t),[H_I(s),\rho_S(s)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]].
\end{equation}
\par Now the Markov approximation is made, assuming
there is no `history dependence' of the system on its previous states
(time locality). The following modifications to the above master
equation are made. First, we remove the history dependence by
replacing $\rho_S(s)\rightarrow\rho_S(t)$. Next the limit on the
integral is taken to infinity, while the replacement
$H_I(s)\rightarrow H_I(t-s)$, so that the integral has no dependence
on the initial time.  Without loss of generality, we let $t=0$ be the
time at which the system is set up. So the final Born-Markov master
equation
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\rho}_S(t)=-\int^\infty_0ds\Tr_B[H_I(t),[H_I(t-s),\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]].
  \label{eqn:bornmark}
\end{equation}
This equation thus determines the dynamics of the system $S$, whilst
taking account of the irreversible losses to an environment. Keeping track of all the environmental degrees of freedom is no longer
required, an assumption about the state of the
environment is all the remains. This would then allow one to evaluate the trace $\Tr_B$
and time integral, as we will now demonstrate.  
\subsection{Dissipation from first principles}
\par One particularly
useful and general approach to the evaluation of the RHS of the
Born-Markov master equation is to introduce a set of eigenoperators of
the system Hamiltonian $H_S$. (This method is outlined in the text book  \textit{The Theory of Open Quantum Systems} by Breuer and Petruccione.) \par The aim in this project is to calculate the full dissipation the interaction picture we have
that
\begin{equation}
	H_I(t) = e^{i(H_S+H_E)t}H_I(0)e^{-i(H_S+H_E)t}.
\end{equation}
Given a general $H_I$, this is not easy to calculate explicitly the
time dependence without the help of the system eigenoperators, which
we now introduce.  \par Suppose we fully understand the system and
environment seperately, that is, we know how to calculate the system
and environment eigenspectrums (this may be always achieved in
principle by numerical diagonalisation) then we may express a
resolution of identity in the following manner (the system alone for
simplicity):
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_S=\sum_{\substack{\forall \epsilon\,\text{s.t.}
    \\ H_S\ket{\epsilon}=\epsilon\ket{\epsilon}}}\outr{\epsilon}{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}
The equivalent expression for the baths is simply the sum of outer
products of Fock basis states (since we model the environment as a
system of oscillators). With the assumption that the interaction is
seperable: $H_I = \sum_i A_i \otimes B_i$, this then allows direct
calculation of the interaction Hamiltonian in the interaction picture:
\begin{align}
H_I(t) &= \sum_i \sum_{\forall\epsilon,\forall\upsilon}
e^{iH_St}\outr{\epsilon}{\epsilon}A_i\outr{\upsilon}{\upsilon}e^{-iH_St}\otimes
B_i(t) \notag \\ &= \sum_i
\sum_{\forall\epsilon,\forall\upsilon}e^{i(\epsilon-\upsilon)t}\bra{\epsilon}A_i\ket{\upsilon}
\outr{\epsilon}{\upsilon}\otimes B_i(t) \notag
\\ &\equiv\sum_i\sum_{\forall\epsilon,\forall\upsilon}e^{i(\epsilon-\upsilon)t}A^i_{\epsilon,\upsilon}\otimes
B_i(t),
\end{align}
where $A^i_{\epsilon,\upsilon} =
\bra{\epsilon}A_i\ket{\upsilon} \outr{\epsilon}{\upsilon}$.
Sometimes it is convenient to rewrite this as a single sum over
possible energy-\textit{differences}, as opposed to an explicit double
sum over energy eigenvalues. To this end, we introduce the energy
eigenoperators of $S$:
\begin{equation}
	A^i_\omega=\sum_{\forall\epsilon,\forall\upsilon}\delta_{\omega,\epsilon-\upsilon}A^i_{\epsilon,\upsilon}.
\end{equation}
With this notation we may then write a single sum to denote sum over
all frequency differences, $\omega$ which gives:
\begin{align}
H_I(t) &=\sum_i\sum_{\omega}e^{i\omega t}A^i_\omega\otimes B_i(t).
\label{eq:intham}
\end{align}
We have thus expressed the interaction picture Hamiltonian in terms of
operators we may readily calculate with. In this technique it is
generally assumed that the environments are vast and can be
represented by harmonic oscillators. All expectations and correlations
of operators acting on such a bath written in terms of the bath's
creation and annihilation operators may be easily calculated. So the
complexity of such expressions as (\ref{eq:intham}) is due the unknown
form of the operators $A^i_\omega$. However, calculation of these
operators is necessary if we want to assure that the full dynamics due
to the system-environment coupling is accounted for.
\subsection{Non-local dissipation to a zero-temperature environment}
In this section a master equation with all non-local contributions included is derived. To evaluate the RHS of the Born-Markov master equation (\ref{eqn:bornmark}), the time dependence of the interaction Hamiltonian $H_I(t)$ in the interaction picture must be determined. One method of choice is to choose a basis of eigenoperators of the system Hamiltonian $H_S$, and this is the approach utilised in this report. Recall the number-conserving interaction Hamiltonian between each spin-site and its unique environment
\begin{equation}
	H_I=\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_k
        \xi_k\left(\sigma^+_ib_{i,k}+\sigma^-_ib^\dagger_{i,k}\right).
\end{equation}
This is can be expressed in terms of the eigenoperators of $H_S$ as
explained in the preceding section. This then gives the interaction
Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
	H_I(t)=\sum_{i,k}\sum_{\omega}\xi_k A^i_\omega
        b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)e^{i\omega t}+\Hc,
    \label{eqn:HIeigen}
\end{equation}
where $A^{i}_\omega =
\sum_{\epsilon,\upsilon}\delta_{\omega,\epsilon-\upsilon}A^{i}_{\epsilon,\upsilon}$
and $A^{i}_{\epsilon,\upsilon} =
\bra{\epsilon}\sigma^-_i\ket{\upsilon} \outr{\epsilon}{\upsilon}$. The
corresponding quantum master equation is obtained upon evaluation of
the right hand side of (\ref{eqn:bornmark}). This involves a double
commutator, which, since the interaction Hamiltonian has two terms,
will in general yield $16$ terms in the master equation. We are going to neglect three quarters of these terms and calculate the expectations with the assumption of empty baths (zero temperature). Expectations with respect to a thermal density matrix, such as (\ref{eqn:thermal}), are (where
$\langle\cdot\rangle=\Tr\{\cdot\,\tilde{\rho}_B\}$):
\begin{align}
	\Big\langle b_{i,k}b_{j,q}\Big\rangle = \left\langle
        b^\dagger_{i,k}b^\dagger_{j,q}\right\rangle &= 0,\notag
        \\ \left\langle
        b^\dagger_{i,k}b_{j,q}\right\rangle &=\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}n(\omega_{k}),\notag\\ \left\langle
        b_{i,k}b^\dagger_{j,q}\right\rangle &=\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}\left(n(\omega_{k})+1\right).
\end{align}
The following replacement is made for \textit{empty thermal
reservoirs}: $n(\omega_{k})\rightarrow 0$, for all modes $k$. The simplification is clear: since the only non-zero two-point correlator is $\langle b_{i,k}b^\dagger_{j,q}\rangle =\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}$, many terms on the RHS of (\ref{eqn:bornmark}) are zero. With this in mind the calculation of the dissipator will now be undertaken. 
\par Before turning the focus to the integral, the first step is to evaluate the traced commutator $\Tr_B[H_I(t),[H_I(t-s),\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]]$ by inserting the eigenoperator representation of $H_I(t)$ as given in (\ref{eqn:HIeigen}).
\begin{align}
	\Tr_B[H_I(t),[H_I(&t-s),\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]],\notag \\ 
	=\sum_{i,j}\sum_{k,q}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}\Tr_B&[\xi_k A^i_\omega
        b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)e^{i\omega t}+\Hc\,,[\xi_q A^{j}_{\omega'}
        b^\dagger_{j,q}(t-s)e^{i\omega' (t-s)}+\Hc\,,\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]], \notag \\
	=\sum_{i,j}\sum_{k,q}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}\Tr_B&([\xi_k A^i_\omega
        b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)e^{i\omega t},[\xi_q A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}
        b_{j,q}(t-s)e^{-i\omega' (t-s)},\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]]\notag \\
	&+[\xi_k A^{i,\dagger}_\omega
        b_{i,k}(t)e^{-i\omega t},[\xi_q A^{j}_{\omega'}
        b^\dagger_{j,q}(t-s)e^{i\omega' (t-s)},\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]]).
        \label{eqn:doubcomm1}
\end{align}
The second to third line step in (\ref{eqn:doubcomm1}) follows by dropping terms which generate traces of the form $\Tr\{b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)b^\dagger_{j,q}(t-s)\tilde{\rho}_B\}$ and $\Tr\{b_{i,k}(t)b_{j,q}(t-s)\tilde{\rho}_B\}$, which are each exactly zero for bosonic particles.
\par The master equation can now be expressed as \footnote{Note that the hermitian conjugate can be written since $[A,[A^\dagger,h]]^\dagger=[A^\dagger,[A,h]]$ if $h=h^\dagger$.}
\begin{align}
\dot{\rho}_S(t)=-\int^\infty_0ds\sum_{i,j}\sum_{k,q}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}\Tr_B[\xi_k A^i_\omega
        b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)&e^{i\omega t},[\xi_q A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}
        b_{j,q}(t-s)e^{-i\omega' (t-s)},\rho_S(t)\otimes\tilde{\rho}_B]] \notag \\
+\Hc
\end{align} 
We now expand the double commutator as $[A,[B,C]]=ABC-ACB-CBA+BCA$ and separate the system operators from the bath operators:
\begin{align}
  \dot{\rho}_S(t)=-\int^\infty_0ds\sum_{i,j}\sum_{k,q}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}&e^{i(\omega-\omega')t}e^{i\omega's}\xi_k\xi_q \notag\\
  \times\Big(& A^i_\omega A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}\rho(t)\Tr_B\{b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)b_{j,q}(t-s)\tilde{\rho}_B\} \notag \\
  - &A^i_\omega\rho(t)A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}\Tr_B\{b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)\tilde{\rho}_Bb_{j,q}(t-s)\}\notag \\
  -& A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}\rho(t)A^i_\omega\Tr_B\{b_{j,q}(t-s)\tilde{\rho}_Bb^\dagger_{i,k}(t)\}\notag \\
  +&\rho(t)A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}A^i_\omega\Tr_B\{\tilde{\rho}_Bb_{j,q}(t-s)b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)\}\Big)\notag\\
&\Gap\Gap\Gap+\Hc,
\end{align}
and we now cyclically permute the traces and use the formulae
\begin{align}
  \Tr_B\{b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)b_{j,q}(t-s)\tilde{\rho}_B\}&=\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}n(\omega_k)e^{-i\omega_ks}\rightarrow 0, \text{and}\notag\\
  \Tr_B\{b_{j,q}(t-s)b^\dagger_{i,k}(t)\tilde{\rho}_B\}&=\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}(n(\omega_k)+1)e^{-i\omega_ks}\notag\\
  &\rightarrow \delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}e^{-i\omega_ks},
\end{align}
to express the master equation as
\begin{align}
  \dot{\rho}_S(t)&=\sum_{i,j}\sum_{k,q}\xi_k\xi_q \delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,q}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}e^{i(\omega-\omega')t}\int^\infty_0dse^{i(\omega'-\omega_k)s}\notag\\
  &\Gap\Gap\Gap\Gap\Gap\times\Big(A^i_\omega\rho(t)A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}-\rho(t)A^{j,\dagger}_{\omega'}A^i_\omega\Big)+\Hc, \notag\\
  &=\sum_{i}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}e^{i(\omega-\omega')t}\sum_{k}\xi^2_k\int^\infty_0dse^{i(\omega'-\omega_k)s}\notag \\
  &\Gap\Gap\Gap\Gap\Gap\times\Big(A^i_\omega\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}-\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}A^i_\omega\Big)+\Hc, \notag\\
  &=\sum_{i}\sum_{\omega,\omega'}e^{i(\omega-\omega')t}\tilde{J}^*(\omega')\Big(A^i_\omega\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}-\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}A^i_\omega\Big)+\Hc,
\end{align}
where we have denoted $\tilde{J}(\omega')$ as the following integral:
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{J}(\omega')=\sum_k\xi^2_k\int_0^\infty ds\, e^{i(\omega_k-\omega')s},
\end{equation}
and now we will discuss the evaluation of this integral.
\par The environment has been implemented into our model by considering $N$ independent quantum harmonic oscillators. One way to characterise the interaction between the system and environment is to write a spectral density function, which for this bosonic environment, is given by $\gamma(\omega)=\pi\sum_k\xi_k\delta(\omega-\omega_k)$. It follows from this equation that the sum over $k$-modes of a function evaluated at the mode frequencies $\omega_k$ can be rewritten:
\begin{equation}
  \pi \sum_k\xi^2_kf(\omega_k) = \int d\omega\, \gamma(\omega)f(\omega).
\end{equation}
This rewriting allows the expression of $\tilde{J}(\omega')$ in terms of the spectral density of each of the identical baths, $\gamma(\omega')$:
\begin{align}
  \tilde{J}(\omega')&=\sum_k\xi^2_k\int_0^\infty ds\, e^{i(\omega_k-\omega')s}, \notag \\
  &=\int \frac{d\omega}{\pi}\gamma(\omega)\int_0^\infty ds\, e^{i(\omega-\omega')s}, \notag\\
  &=\int \frac{d\omega}{\pi}\gamma(\omega)\left(\frac{i}{\omega-\omega'+i0}\right), \notag\\
  &=\gamma(\omega')+i\int\frac{d\omega}{\pi}\gamma(\omega)\mathbbm{P}\frac{1}{\omega-\omega'}.
\end{align}
In going from line one to two, the property of $\gamma(\omega')$ has been utilised, followed by the standard technique of regularising the integrand and expressing the result in terms of the principle value $\mathbbm{P}$. For what following in the rest of the report, we are going to assume that $\gamma(\omega')$ is real and that it has a functional form such that the principal value integral is exactly zero. This allows us to make the simplification $\tilde{J}(\omega')=\tilde{J}^*(\omega')=\gamma(\omega')$.
\par Putting this all together gives us the master equation in the interaction picture:
\begin{align}
\dot{\rho}_S(t) &= \sum_i
\sum_{\omega,\omega'}\gamma(\omega')e^{i(\omega-\omega')t}\notag
\\ &\times\Big(A^{i}_{\omega}\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}+A^{i}_{\omega'}\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_\omega-A^{i,\dagger}_\omega A^{i}_{\omega'}\rho(t)-\rho(t) A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}A^{i}_{\omega} \Big).
\end{align}
To eliminate the explicit time dependence, encoded in the oscillatory
term $e^{i(\omega-\omega')t}$, we move back into the Schr\"odinger
picture, which re-introduces the unitary evolution and results in
\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho}(t) = -i[H_S,\rho(t)] + \sum_i
\mathcal{D}_i\rho(t),
\label{eqn:mstr}
\end{equation}
where the dissipator $\mathcal{D}_i\rho(t)$ is given in terms
of the eigenoperators of $H_S$ as
\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_i\rho(t)=\sum_{\omega,\omega'}J(\omega')\Big(
A^{i,\dagger}_\omega A^{i}_{\omega'}\rho(t) + \rho(t)
A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}A^{i}_{\omega} -
A^{i}_{\omega'}\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_\omega-A^{i}_{\omega}\rho(t)A^{i,\dagger}_{\omega'}\Big)
\end{align}
